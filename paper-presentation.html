# Giving an Academic Talk to Peers
## A Perspective of a Mediocre Presenter
### David Ubilava
### October, 2021

# Just a formula

- This presentation is about giving an academic talk.
- It is also about presenting the said talk to academics.
- This is not the presentation formula. 
- It is just a formula for a presentation.

---


# Who cares?

- A research project usually culminates in a publication.
- Along the way, typically once the complete draft of the paper is ready, the author(s) present the study to the interested parties, usually to other academics.
- When done skillfully, a presentation can play a decisive role in the ultimate success of the paper, measured by the quality of the journal it is ultimately published, or the number of citations it subsequently receives. 

---


# The formulas

- A typical research paper consists of the introduction (see [Keith Head's post](http://blogs.ubc.ca/khead/research/research-advice/formula)), the conclusion (see [Marc Bellemare's post](https://marcfbellemare.com/wordpress/12060)), and the 'middle bits' (see [Marc Bellemare's post](https://marcfbellemare.com/wordpress/12797)).

---


# From paper to presentation

- The proportions and composition of different bits change somewhat as we map a paper onto a presentation. 
- But generally, what is true about the paper is also true about the presentation:
  * The Introduction is the most important section of the paper/presentation.
  * The opening paragraphs/slides are the most important parts of the introduction.

---


# Get to the point soon(er)

- It is important in papers, and more so in presentations, to get to the point of she study early.
- In the paper:
  * state the research question on the first page.
- In the presentation:
  * state the research question on the first slide. 
  * offer the 'answer' to the question&amp;mdash;the takeaway message of the study&amp;mdash;on the next slide.
- When done in this way, the message will stick with the audience throughout the presentation.

---

# Use words (and slides) scarcely

- A slide should have as few words as possible, but not fewer.
- (Do as I say not as I do).
- Each slide counts.
- Each bullet point matters.
- The word-count is not the number of words that appear on a slide, rather it's the number of words the presenter says while on that slide.
- (One slide per one minute of a talk is my rule of thumb).

---


# Use illustrations generously

- A picture is worth a nine-hundred-and-ninety-five words (the other five words are reserved to label the axes).
- In the paper:
  * a figure should be self-contained.
  * this is usually achieved by properly labeling the axes, and by providing coherent footnotes.
- In the presentation:
  * you are the 'coherent footnote.'

---


# Use tables... NOT

- A table is not worth a slide. 
- In the paper:
  * a table can be useful as it documents exact values of some important statistics.
  * a table, like figure, should be self-contained.
- In the presentation:
  * convert tables to figures or to words. 
  * (you and your audience can thank me later).
  * if you must have a table, keep it small (no more than a few rows and columns) even if its 'paper variant' is large.
  * create the slide-specific table, do not paste its snapshot.

---


# Math and equations

- Use equations sparingly unless, of course, the paper is about the equations.
- In the paper:
  * explain every detail of each equation, every bit of its Greek and Latin characters.
- In the presentation:
  * provide just enough detail for the key equation(s), refer the audience to the paper.
  * type equations, do not paste their snapshots.

---


# Adopt your style, adapt to audience

- People (presenters) vary, and so will the presentations.
- Audience and forums vary, and so should the presentations.

---


# Invite the audience to your journey

- The point of the presentation is to make the people in the room start caring about your work.
- They may or may not like it, and they may or may not have a good reason for that, but so long as they care enough to participate in the dialogue, you have won the audience.

---


# Have a conversation

- A presentation is meant to be a dialogue, not a monologue. 
- It is, indeed, a conversation among the peers, and everyone in the room is part of it.
- You just happen to know the most about the topic&amp;mdash;because it is *your* topic&amp;mdash;and, thus, you get to lead the conversation.
- Take questions from the audience gracefully because, you know, that's how conversations work.

---


# Practice makes perfect

- Giving a presentation can be stressful&amp;mdash;it often is.
- Experience reduces the degree of stressfulness, but that takes time (years).
- In the short run: practice makes perfect.

---


# Enjoy the process

- No presentation is perfect in absolute sense, however.
- But it doesn't have to be perfect for it to be enjoyable.
- Enjoyable to you as well as to your audience.
- Aim for that, and everything else will just fall in place.
